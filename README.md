Point system for MarBar (dormatory party thing)
A lot of polishing is still needed for this site


A simple site for keeping track of points

the front page features scores for the active "marbar" along with a graph of the points and a time tracker of how long the "marbar" have left
the management site allos a superuser to add new users as well as creating new marbars (only one can be active at any time)
the event page features events connected to the active marbar
the add_points page is for adding points to the units connected to the active marbar

a user can be either a superuser (unlimited acess to everything) or a normal user (created by a superuser, 
can manage and assigne events and points to marbar's it is connected to)
no login is required for the front page and the event page.


ToDo:
The graph is not working when trying to employ the "tick" rendering options of "jqplot"
The picture for the front page needs to be able to be changed from the management page
The styling of the page obviously needs a lot of work
